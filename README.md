# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe using React and Vite.

## Project Structure

- `App.jsx`: This is the main component of the application. It manages the game state and renders the game board and player components.
- `Player.jsx`: This component represents a player. It displays the player's symbol and indicates whether it's the player's turn.
- `GameBoard.jsx`: This component represents the game board. It renders a grid of squares, and each square can be clicked to make a move.
- `Log.jsx`: This component displays a log of the game turns.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the application using `npm run dev` (as this project uses Vite).

## How to Play

1. The game starts with player X's turn.
2. Click on a square to make a move.
3. The game alternates between player X and player O.
4. The game log displays each player's moves.

Enjoy the game!
